This repository contains the code and results for two different genome assembly methods, Spades and Abyss. 

Abyss produces  more files than SPAdes, 
including quality assessment files and histograms. The Abyss assembly produced a genome that is closer to the length of the reference genome (4951383 bp) 
than the SPAdes assembly. The Abyss assembly also seemed more contiguous than the SPAdes assembly given the higher N50 and lower number of contigs in
the Abyss output. The GC content for Abyss assembly was also slightly closer to that of the reference (52.24).

These genomes were also annotated using two methods, RAST and Prokka. Unlike Prokka, RAST contextualizes annotated genes by placing them in their
respective biological networks.
