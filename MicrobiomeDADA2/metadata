This repository contains R code that I used for microbiome analyses of several bird species. The data came from my professor, Dr. Tricia Van Laar, and her research
on avian microbiomes. 

The code here cleans 16S RNA reads and assigns taxonomies. The code also performs analyses that compare the diversity of the microbiome between bird populations.
